       "      <td>Jennifer Chiaverini continues her quest to be known as more than the author of the Elm Creek Quilt novels, which was truly a wonderful series. I truly enjoyed her first book about historic women in history, Mrs. Lincoln&amp;#8217;s Dressmaker. The Spymistress missed the mark with me a bit as it read in places more like a history textbook instead of fiction. In Mrs. Lincoln&amp;#8217;s Rival she pulls back on the history book feel and gives the story a more fictional feel. But it just didn&amp;#8217;t hit the heights of Mrs. Lincoln&amp;#8217;s Dressmaker.These women of history are ones that are not as well known and it was very interesting getting to know Kate Chase Sprague but while there was a bit of tension between her and Mrs. Lincoln I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call it a rivalry. Kate Chase was her father&amp;#8217;s right hand during his pursuit to become President and while he was Secretary of the Treasury.  She was very savvy and smart and knew how to garner favor and make the right connections. Her own endeavor to become First Lady whether it be with her father as President or as the wife of the &amp;#8220;Boy Governor&amp;#8221; from Rhode Island was so strong she made some interesting decisions. I also found her to be very spoiled and demanding that rings just a little wrong for the time period, but I know the author researches these women intensively. She tries very hard to stick to the facts and not overly embellish but at times it comes across as just a bit dry and this reader wanting more. I get the feeling the marriage between Kate and William was quite volatile and more details on that could have really turned this story on its ear.The Civil War was a terrible time in history but in ways it correlates to the division in our country today, thankfully without the bloodshed on American soil. I found some of the actions taken by Congress and President Lincoln depicted in this book very telling in the ways history repeats itself.  Sometimes it is easier to see when the situations are fictionalized but based on facts.If Chiaverini continues this road of writing about historic women I know she will hit the right balance between the fact and the fiction because she is an excellent writer.  I am anxious to see who she will choose for her next subject. All three of these books were educational. I encourage the author not to be afraid of being a little more creative in her storytelling. They are fiction and readers are comfortable with the facts being muddied a bit to give the story a more natural flow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thomas Cromwell, the villain of A Man for All Seasons, is the protagonist of this historical novel set around the rise of Anne Boleyn. A devoted assistant of Cardinal Wolsey, he nevertheless survives the cardinal's fall and rises to become one of the king's closest advisors, advancing the Anne Boleyn marriage while working behind the scenes for the rise of Protestantism. He remains first and foremost a practical man, equally uncomprehending of fanatics of both Catholic and Protestant stripes. Naturally, as he rises he attracts enemies, but at home, a passel of young people and servants are devoted to him.I found the novel terribly dry, but somehow compelling. The reader is held at arm's length, understanding Cromwell much more through his actions and conversations than his thoughts, into which the reader is rarely invited. The cast of characters is truly bewildering, but clear portraits emerge of a few big names, most notably the royal family and Thomas More, portrayed here as cold and sanctimonious--wearing a hair shirt, humiliating his wife, taking financial advantage of his wards. Henry appears as immature and petulant, perpetually self-centered. Among the bit players, many blur together, though Mary Boleyn stands out--jealous and grasping, yet somehow appealing in her openness. Not for the easily bored, this is a long, dense novel and much more about political machinations than the emotions and motivations of actual people. Adding further difficulties, the author insists on always referring to Cromwell as \"he,\" even when another \"he\" is present and even when the two are easily confused. Already not a fast read, the novel slows the reader down further by requiring one to repeatedly pause and tease out who said what. I finished the novel, but do not plan to look for the sequel Mantel is reportedly writing. In summation, I can see that this is a \"good book,\" but I didn't have any fun reading it.</td>\n",

Reading this book requires a fairly strong background in tudor history, particularly concerning the Anne Boleyn saga.  With this knowledge, this book provides a very detailed account of Henry's attempt to secure a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and provides much insight of the workings of the world of the renaissance ambassador to the papal court.  Without this knowledge, this would be a confusing array of names without context.I was very familiar with the English side of the divorce but my knowledge of what happened at the papal court was reduced to -Pope Clement was in an undesirable position because Rome had just been sacked by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, who was the nephew of Catherine of Aragon.  This book provided the back story to the sack of Rome and the political maneuvering that occurred as Henry's professional diplomats tried to secure the support of the various cardinals and Universities whose support was vital to convincing the pope to grant a divorce.  Why didn't pope Clement VII not just defy Charles and give the divorce?  I truly did not understand how difficult Clement's position was and how weakened he was by Charles. This book also  provides much detail on the working of the Renaissance diplomat and how they functioned within the papal court.The writing is fairly detailed but flowed well.  Overall, I would recommend.</td>\n",

The problem I had with the book was that it is overly detailed for my purposes.  Perhaps if I was a student of British history -- particularly British naval warfare of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries -- and had a more abiding interest and familiarity with the history of those remarkable times, I would have had a greater interest in the subject matter.  In any case, I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this otherwise well writter and very, very detailed biography.</td>\n",

       "8  Jennifer Chiaverini continues her quest to be known as more than the author of the Elm Creek Quilt novels, which was truly a wonderful series. I truly enjoyed her first book about historic women in history, Mrs. Lincoln&#8217;s Dressmaker. The Spymistress missed the mark with me a bit as it read in places more like a history textbook instead of fiction. In Mrs. Lincoln&#8217;s Rival she pulls back on the history book feel and gives the story a more fictional feel. But it just didn&#8217;t hit the heights of Mrs. Lincoln&#8217;s Dressmaker.These women of history are ones that are not as well known and it was very interesting getting to know Kate Chase Sprague but while there was a bit of tension between her and Mrs. Lincoln I wouldn&#8217;t call it a rivalry. Kate Chase was her father&#8217;s right hand during his pursuit to become President and while he was Secretary of the Treasury.  She was very savvy and smart and knew how to garner favor and make the right connections. Her own endeavor to become First Lady whether it be with her father as President or as the wife of the &#8220;Boy Governor&#8221; from Rhode Island was so strong she made some interesting decisions. I also found her to be very spoiled and demanding that rings just a little wrong for the time period, but I know the author researches these women intensively. She tries very hard to stick to the facts and not overly embellish but at times it comes across as just a bit dry and this reader wanting more. I get the feeling the marriage between Kate and William was quite volatile and more details on that could have really turned this story on its ear.The Civil War was a terrible time in history but in ways it correlates to the division in our country today, thankfully without the bloodshed on American soil. I found some of the actions taken by Congress and President Lincoln depicted in this book very telling in the ways history repeats itself.  Sometimes it is easier to see when the situations are fictionalized but based on facts.If Chiaverini continues this road of writing about historic women I know she will hit the right balance between the fact and the fiction because she is an excellent writer.  I am anxious to see who she will choose for her next subject. All three of these books were educational. I encourage the author not to be afraid of being a little more creative in her storytelling. They are fiction and readers are comfortable with the facts being muddied a bit to give the story a more natural flow.   \n",
       "3  Thomas Cromwell, the villain of A Man for All Seasons, is the protagonist of this historical novel set around the rise of Anne Boleyn. A devoted assistant of Cardinal Wolsey, he nevertheless survives the cardinal's fall and rises to become one of the king's closest advisors, advancing the Anne Boleyn marriage while working behind the scenes for the rise of Protestantism. He remains first and foremost a practical man, equally uncomprehending of fanatics of both Catholic and Protestant stripes. Naturally, as he rises he attracts enemies, but at home, a passel of young people and servants are devoted to him.I found the novel terribly dry, but somehow compelling. The reader is held at arm's length, understanding Cromwell much more through his actions and conversations than his thoughts, into which the reader is rarely invited. The cast of characters is truly bewildering, but clear portraits emerge of a few big names, most notably the royal family and Thomas More, portrayed here as cold and sanctimonious--wearing a hair shirt, humiliating his wife, taking financial advantage of his wards. Henry appears as immature and petulant, perpetually self-centered. Among the bit players, many blur together, though Mary Boleyn stands out--jealous and grasping, yet somehow appealing in her openness. Not for the easily bored, this is a long, dense novel and much more about political machinations than the emotions and motivations of actual people. Adding further difficulties, the author insists on always referring to Cromwell as \"he,\" even when another \"he\" is present and even when the two are easily confused. Already not a fast read, the novel slows the reader down further by requiring one to repeatedly pause and tease out who said what. I finished the novel, but do not plan to look for the sequel Mantel is reportedly writing. In summation, I can see that this is a \"good book,\" but I didn't have any fun reading it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "7  I am rating this a four star book with one caveat- this is for the Tudor history enthusiast.  Reading this book requires a fairly strong background in tudor history, particularly concerning the Anne Boleyn saga.  With this knowledge, this book provides a very detailed account of Henry's attempt to secure a divorce from Catherine of Aragon and provides much insight of the workings of the world of the renaissance ambassador to the papal court.  Without this knowledge, this would be a confusing array of names without context.I was very familiar with the English side of the divorce but my knowledge of what happened at the papal court was reduced to -Pope Clement was in an undesirable position because Rome had just been sacked by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, who was the nephew of Catherine of Aragon.  This book provided the back story to the sack of Rome and the political maneuvering that occurred as Henry's professional diplomats tried to secure the support of the various cardinals and Universities whose support was vital to convincing the pope to grant a divorce.  Why didn't pope Clement VII not just defy Charles and give the divorce?  I truly did not understand how difficult Clement's position was and how weakened he was by Charles. This book also  provides much detail on the working of the Renaissance diplomat and how they functioned within the papal court.The writing is fairly detailed but flowed well.  Overall, I would recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4  I really enjoy historical fiction, particularly about the Boleyn/Henry VIII era.  This book was a bit too detailed, a bit too wordy, sometimes felt a little disjointed and hard to follow.  It was, however, interesting to learn a bit more about Thomas Cromwell.

       "9  this book is the best of its kind this year! i can only think of one other book that is as respectful and insightful about non professional theatre. (it's called 'the stuff of dreams' and sadly is out of print)not only does michael sokolove write a respectful and enlightening biography of his former high school teacher lou volpe, he prseents volpe's career as mentor and huie without making him seem unreal. that's no easy feat considering that volpe's program is the leader in high school theatre. and volpe's accomplishments didn't happen because hi was a svengali of sorts--no, he just loved theatre and his community of levittown, pennsylvania. and he gave so much to both of them!i willbe buying this book formy personal library the second it hits the shleves. and i encourage ALL teachers of theatre to do the same so that it doesn't suffer the same fate as my other favorite book about non-professional theatre. because this is more than 'glee'; this is a life for so many people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "6  I'm sure that \"The Nelson Touch\" deserves a better rating than I gave it. The biography provided a very detaild examination of the life, and to a degree the times, of Admiral Horation Nelson, the 18th Century's preeminent naval strategist and naval leader, the hero of  the Battle of Trafalgar who led the British Navy's forces of 28 ships in defeating a larger combined French and Spanish fleet. The problem I had with the book was that it is overly detailed for my purposes.  Perhaps if I was a student of British history -- particularly British naval warfare of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries -- and had a more abiding interest and familiarity with the history of those remarkable times, I would have had a greater interest in the subject matter.  In any case, I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this otherwise well writter and very, very detailed biography.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1  I've read Seligman's other books and I would recommend buying any of those if you haven't read them yet.  They are full of actual tips on how to improve your well-being.  This book has a few sprinkled throughout the musings of a man reviewing his own history and career accomplishments. I didn't give it one star because the tips that you do find are helpful and the book is interesting in it's own right but I don't think it will \"help you flourish\" as the cover indicates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "5  This is a &quot;more approachable&quot; version of Meyendorff's larger and more scholarly tome on St. Palamas, which remains to this day the definitive work on the monk.  This shorter version includes numerous  photographs and a good level of background/historical detail.  Those with a  general (non-scholarly) interest in learning more about Gregory Palamas  will find it especially convenient; though it will fail to satisfy those  with a desire for in-depth academic information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2  The stage play and recent movie adaptation of the play are fabulous. My wife and I have yet been to either the theater or the movie without hearing sobbing throughout.the book on the other hand is a very difficult read. Hugo drones on and on and on until a topic is overworked that you wonder if you can muster the focus to continue. I applaud the playwrights for their ability to find such a wonderful story within the 1200 plus pages of this book.This is my 3rd attempt to read the unabridged version. I think I will fail in this attempt as well. 60 pages and I am still reading about the bishop!!! My wife tells me the abridged version is a very good read.Good luck to all and congratulations to those that can finish!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
